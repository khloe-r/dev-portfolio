        This summer I’m interning as a Software Engineer at <span className="highlight">Wealthsimple</span>.<br /> <br />
        I’ve always been passionate about tech since learning to code in elementary school. From hackathons and school clubs to publishing a children’s coding book I can’t wait to change the world with CS!
